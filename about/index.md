We value intersectional feminism, our local tech community and nerding out. We are working on building a supportive and inclusive culture in the Calgary tech community, while having  a ridiculous amount  of fun.

Currently, our events  include:

- Book club on feminist, sci-fi, and tech/work related  topics
- Maker sessions  to  work on crafts and projects

We  also enjoy participating in other community events. Youâ€™ll often find us at [Nerd Nite Calgary](http://calgary.nerdnite.com/) and [Pixels & Pints](http://www.meetup.com/pxandpints/). If you have similar values - and are looking for a fun, <del>sarcastic</del> and supportive community in Calgary -  join us on Meetup.
