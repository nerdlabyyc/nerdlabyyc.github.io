We value intersectional feminism, our local community and nerding out. We are working on building a supportive and inclusive culture in the Calgary digital and tech community, while having a ridiculous amount of fun.

## Events

Currently, our events include:

- Project Sessions (monthly)
- Short Reads (quarterly)

If you have similar values - and are looking for a fun, <del>sarcastic</del> and supportive community in Calgary -  join us on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NerdLab-YYC/).
