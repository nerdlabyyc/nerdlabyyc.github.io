Then, take the next 10 minutes to work on a rough draft of your talk proposal. I recommend starting with the description first. Answer each question on your worksheet. 1 sentence per question is fine. Then, write a descriptive title for your talk. There are a few examples for you on page 6.

There, you'll find a place to take notes and jot down the time it's taking you to get through your talk. So over the next 15 minutes, I'd like for you to practice your talk twice, and make any adjustments that you need to. Once you've practiced twice, please upload your slides as quickly as possible to the Slides folder in your group's Google Drive. Once you've uploaded your slides, you can keep practicing if you still have time.</figcaption>

### Thank You

Thank you to [Julie Pagano](http://juliepagano.com) for the source material for this workshop! NerdLab YYC definitely could not have done it without you.

Also, thank you to Poornima Vijayashanker and Karen Catlin for providing free ebook copies of their book [Present! A Techie's Guide to Public Speaking](http://femgineer.com/present-book/) to our workshop attendees. Here's my review!

<figure class="blockquote">
<blockquote>
<p>I've given a few talks before, and I've previously struggled to find one specific resource for tips and tricks on public speaking. This book answers so many of the questions that I've had and so many of the questions I didn't even know to ask. There are many personal anecdotes and examples throughout the book, and these examples really helped me to understand how to implement the strategies found within each section. And while I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in public speaking, the tech-specific advice (e.g. how to present code on slides) is especially helpful.</p>

<p>I've been having a lot of fun going back through the activities as I put together a new talk. And you better believe I've been practicing power poses.</p>

<p>Thank you to Poornima Vijayashanker and Karen Catlin for this invaluable resource.</p>
