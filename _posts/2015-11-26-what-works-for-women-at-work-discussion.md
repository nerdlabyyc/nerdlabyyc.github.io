<span class="italic">[What Works for Women at Work: Four Patterns Working Women Need to Know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17920210-what-works-for-women-at-work)</span> has been my favourite work-related read in long while. It's straightforward and doesn't sugar coat what it means to be a woman in the workplace. Joan C. Williams and Rachel Dempsey comb through 35 years of research and 127 interviews with successful women to provide the reader with a book packed full of advice. I recommend this book to any woman (or any ally) looking to understand more about biases at work.

In their book, Williams and Dempsey discuss [four patterns of gender bias](http://www.genderbiasbingo.com/):

- Prove It Again: When women have to work twice as hard to get half as far.
- The Tightrope: When women must choose between being liked and being respected.
- Maternal Wall: When mothers are assumed to be incompetent and uncommitted.
- Tug of War: When gender bias turns into conflicts among women.

They also cover Double Jeopardy, which is how gender bias differs (and is often worse) for women of color.

Throughout the book, Williams and Dempsey recognize that not all of their advice will work for (or be attractive to) every woman. I really appreciated that they pointed out that sometimes what works for one woman could get another woman into trouble.

I would have loved to have read information on transgender women, women with disabilities, and more on lesbian women, but I also understand that we need more research on a variety of women's experiences. Overall, <span class="italic">What Works for Women at Work</span> is an excellent book full of experiences that you'll identify with and advice that you'll appreciate.
