  <p>We value intersectional feminism, our local tech community and nerding out. We are working on building a supportive and inclusive culture in the Calgary tech community, while having  a ridiculous amount  of fun.<p>

  <p>Currently, our events  include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Book club on feminist, sci-fi, and tech/work related  topics</li>
    <li>Maker sessions  to  work on crafts and projects</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We  also enjoy participating in other community events. Youâ€™ll often find us at <a href="http://calgary.nerdnite.com/">Nerd Nite Calgary</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pxandpints/">Pixels & Pints</a>. If you have similar values - and are looking for a fun, <span class="strikethrough">sarcastic</span> and supportive community in Calgary -  join us on Meetup.</p>
