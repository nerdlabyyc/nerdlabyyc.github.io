In case you missed it, NerdLab YYC was featured in the new Calgary Guardian last month!

<figure class="blockquote">
<blockquote>
<p>When Hannah Sanford, Heather Tovey and Jenn Fitzgerald started a Meetup group last November for ‘intersectional feminist nerds who work in tech’, they expected to draw in (at most) thirty to fifty members.</p>

<p>Imagine their surprise when, in less than a year, the group ballooned to a size of over three hundred members. It’s clear that their mission statement to ‘work on building a supportive and inclusive culture in the Calgary tech community’ has resounded with more than a few people.</p>
