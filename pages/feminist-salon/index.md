NerdLab YYC is happy to bring feminist salons to Calgary! This timeless style of gathering and discussion has been around for centuries and continues to grow in popularity.

## So, what is a "salon"?

Wikipedia (because, you know, the internet) defines a [salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)) as "a gathering of people under the roof of an inspiring host, held partly to amuse one another and partly to refine the taste and increase the knowledge of the participants through conversation".

As intersectional feminists, the NerdLab YYC Salon will be focused on creating a space for people to come together to discuss and learn more about feminist topics - whether that's feminism in the media, pop culture, principles and practice, or inspiring one another to further feminist exploration.

## What do I need to know/bring?

â€‹You don't need much to attend and participate. Come armed with an open mind and a willingness to listen and discuss. It's great if you have a question or something in mind for the discussion based on the theme or topic. Read an interesting article? Post it and we'll talk about it! Have a question about feminism in practice? We want to share our experiences and support one another. We're excited to have some healthy discussion about feminism and welcome all who think that would be pretty awesome too.

Whether you're as excited as we are about this idea, or simply curious enough to check it out, we'll see you at NerdLab YYC's [Feminist Salons](http://www.meetup.com/NerdLab-YYC/events/230217743/).
