We value intersectional feminism, our local community and nerding out. We are working on building a supportive and inclusive culture in the Calgary digital and tech community, while having a ridiculous amount of fun.

## Events

Currently, our events  include:

- Project Sessions
- [Salons (aka discussion groups)](/feminist-salon)
- Workshops:
  * Learn to Speak at Tech Events
  * Ally Skills
- Book Club

We also enjoy participating in other community events. You'll often find us at [Pixels & Pints](http://www.meetup.com/pxandpints/), [Calgary UX](http://calgaryux.com) and [Nerd Nite Calgary](http://calgary.nerdnite.com/). If you have similar values - and are looking for a fun, <del>sarcastic</del> and supportive community in Calgary -  join us on Meetup.
