    <p>We've had a lot of fun getting to work with you all to make Calgary's digital and tech spaces more inclusive. Unfortunately, it's time for us to move on.</p>
    <p>While NerdLab YYC may no longer be around, we can definitely recommend Calgary Learning Code for all of your Project Session needs. They've taken over our monthly Project Sessions group and made it even better. For more information on their Code & Coffee meetups, check out their <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ladies-learning-code-meet-up-calgary-tickets-43485915544">Eventbrite</a> page.</p>
    <p>Until we meet again,</p>
